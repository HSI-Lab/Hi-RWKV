## ðŸš€ Highlights
- **Novel Architecture**: First hierarchical encoder integrating bidirectional RWKV for dense pixel-wise hyperspectral recognition.
- **Linear-Complexity Global Modeling**: Achieves spectralâ€“spatial dependency modeling with *O(N)* complexity.
- **Shift-Based Spatial Mixing**: Captures omnidirectional spatial relationships efficiently.
- **Progressive Resolution Reduction**: Maintains discriminative features while reducing memory cost.
- **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Consistent improvements over CNN-, Transformer-, and Mamba-based baselines on four benchmarks.

## ðŸ“Š Experimental Results

We evaluate Hi-RWKV on **Indian Pines**, **XuZhou**, **HongHu**, and **HanChuan** datasets.  
Hi-RWKV consistently achieves **higher OA, AA, and Kappa** than SOTA baselines, especially in low-data regimes (0.01%-1%).
