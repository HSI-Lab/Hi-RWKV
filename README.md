## 🔍 Overview

**Hi-RWKV** is a hierarchical hyperspectral image (HSI) classification framework that introduces **RWKV-based global modeling** into dense pixel-wise spectral–spatial representation learning.

Unlike convolutional neural networks that rely on local receptive fields and Transformers that incur quadratic complexity, Hi-RWKV leverages the **linear-complexity RWKV architecture** to efficiently capture long-range spectral–spatial dependencies.  
A multi-stage hierarchical design further enables progressive resolution reduction while preserving discriminative information, making the framework particularly suitable for **large-scale hyperspectral scenes and low-label learning scenarios**.

---

## 🚀 Key Contributions

- **Hierarchical RWKV Encoder for HSI**  
  We propose the first hierarchical encoder that integrates RWKV blocks into dense hyperspectral image classification, enabling effective global dependency modeling in both spectral and spatial domains.

- **Linear-Complexity Global Modeling**  
  RWKV replaces self-attention for long-range context modeling, achieving *O(N)* complexity with respect to the number of tokens while maintaining strong representational capacity.

- **Efficient Dense Prediction**  
  Progressive resolution reduction balances computational efficiency and classification accuracy, enabling high-resolution dense prediction with reduced memory overhead.

- **State-of-the-Art Performance**  
  Extensive experiments on multiple hyperspectral benchmarks demonstrate that Hi-RWKV consistently outperforms CNN-, Transformer-, and Mamba-based methods, especially under extremely low training ratios.

## 📊 Experimental Results
![Results](./png/results.png)
Hi-RWKV is evaluated on four widely used hyperspectral benchmarks:

- **Indian Pines**
- **XuZhou**
- **HongHu**
- **HanChuan**

Across all datasets, Hi-RWKV achieves **higher Overall Accuracy (OA), Average Accuracy (AA), and Kappa coefficient** than state-of-the-art baselines, with particularly strong gains in **low-data regimes (e.g., 0.01%–1% labeled samples)**.

## ⚙️ Configuration-Driven Training

Example:

```bash
python train_HiRWKV.py --config config/hanchuan.yaml
```

Available configurations:

```text
config/
├── hanchuan.yaml
├── honghu.yaml
├── indianpines.yaml
└── xuzhou.yaml
```

This design ensures:
- Clear separation between **model implementation** and **experimental setup**
- Easy ablation and architecture comparison
- High reproducibility for peer verification

## 🛠️ Prerequisites: RWKV CUDA Extension

**Before running any training or evaluation code, please install the RWKV CUDA extension.**

Hi-RWKV relies on CUDA-accelerated RWKV kernels for efficient sequence modeling.
Make sure that:
- Your CUDA version matches your PyTorch build
- The installation completes without compilation errors
